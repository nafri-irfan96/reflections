When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So that it gets easier for more than one person to work on simultaneously and to be able to access the project from another system.
	There are many other reasons as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the Git is not keen enough to understand when I want to synchronize with the github. It might happen because we want to experiment on some changes in the project and pulling the data automatically makes us lose our changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used when we want to work on a someone else's project and keeping them notified about the changes that we are making.
	Clone is used when we just want to make a copy of the repository to our local system without making any changes in our github account.
	Branch is used to make a different version of a commit. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that we can know the most recent commit that is being worked on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Working on projects without using github is a tedious job and often leads to confusion when we are not sure about some particular changes that we are making. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
