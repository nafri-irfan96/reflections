When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So that it gets easier for more than one person to work on simultaneously and to be able to access the project from another system.
	There are many other reasons as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the Git is not keen enough to understand when I want to synchronize with the github. It might happen because we want to experiment on some changes in the project and pulling the data automatically makes us lose our changes.
